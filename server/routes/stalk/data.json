I just think there are some things we could handle better (transitioning of Iraqi government/army) and some things that we need to be honest about (we're not financially supporting groups in Syria because we care about civil rights, we're doing it because we want to hurt Kremlin interests).\n\n&gt;I generally agree with this. Although, you have to remember that the Iraqi army wasn't a normal professional army like the western ones.\n\nI'm aware that there were [many problems](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-military-analysis/iraqi-military-breakdown-fueled-by-corruption-politics-idUSKBN0EO2FK20140614) related to the Iraqi military, but we kind of disbanded the last one that was there, so there is some onus on us to make sure what we leave behind in somewhat functional, no?\n\n&gt;Huh? [Maliki] came to power through a free and fair election? \n\nI don't know if I 100% agree with this characterization of what happened. I'll quote, you can tell me if you disagree with the source -\n\n&gt;[Iraq had held elections in December for a four-year government, and Jafaari secured enough backing among the Shiite parties for a second full term. But the Americans made clear they would reject another four years of Jafaari, especially after Samarra. It was apparent, however, that Dawa and the Sadrists would only abandon Jafaari if another Dawa member replaced him. During a four-month stalemate, Maliki emerged as a dark horse candidate. The Americans played the role of kingmaker. U.S. Ambassador Zalamay Khalilzad interviewed the candidates, and his staff drew spreadsheets charting candidates’ positions.](https://worldpolicy.org/2015/04/13/the-rise-of-nouri-al-maliki/)\n\nNow this is a far cry from \"America hand-picked the Iraqi PM against the will of the people\", but we definitely had a hand in his rise to power.\n\n&gt;The majority of people supported him until 2010 or so.\n\nThis is when his popularity was at an all-time high, but this came off the back of an extremely reckless attack against the Sadrists in Basra. His victory here was almost entirely carried by American support. Also, earlier American-lead military victories (when The Awakening was largely supported by US involvement) was allowed to be entirely claimed by Maliki's regime. Those same Sunni fighters that were involved in the Awakening were largely arrested/hunted down by Maliki after we turned their files over to him as well.\n\n&gt;In fact, he wanted to pursue a third term, and the US had a hand in forcing him to step down.\n\n...This was because he lost the election, no??? My understanding is that he was trying to challenge the results in court, but there was immense international pressure for him to step down due to his miserable failings in unifying the country.\n\nfuck my flight is boarding to London I'll try to respond to the rest of this later.","link":"https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/d345gx/discussion_thread/ezzl3i4/"},{"type":"Twitter","date":1568286111,"text":"RT @closedapp: when ur girl sees you enjoying ur nap but wants attention.\n https://t.co/mL1amaZQqT","link":"https://twitter.com/modalsevenths/statuses/1172103019355205633"},{"type":"Reddit","date":1568281702,"text":"lol I'll ignore the condescension and bite.\n\n&gt; First of all, how do you logically attribute what happened in Syria and the refugee crisis to the US? \n\nNothing in the Middle East is as simple as \"one party caused all of these issues,\" but the US' involvement in the Middle East definitely exacerbated these issues. I don't have sources on hand for this atm, so we can go back and forth if you want to dig stuff up, but here's my understanding of some general events that occurred that helped ISIS grow in its initial stages -\n\n1) The dismantling of the Iraqi regime and the subsequent barring of the Ba'ath members from ever participating in the government after left both the governing body and the army in a highly compromised state.\n\n2) Our support of Maliki afterwards undermined the \"peace\" in Iraq by setting the stage for Sunni retaliation.\n\n3) ISIS was able to lift a lot of US equipment from Iraq due to their army's inability to maintain/secure all of it.\n\n4) The US had a vested interest in supporting the FSA in Syria and was invested removing Assad from power.\n\n5) The US was funding/sending arms (this last claim is really disputed I think? and involves some convoluted sending of arms through channels in Turkey) to groups in Syria to fight against Assad.\n\n6) Turkey (US ally) was shipping massive amounts of oil up from the ISIS-controlled regions of Syria.\n\n7) US withdrawal from Iraq was premature and done for political approval rather than military approval\n\nThere are some other things I remember reading that were a bit less-believable (Israel involvement, Turkey military involvement, etc...), but I believe most of this prior claims I researched to be pretty sure. If you have other information or dispute it we can hammer out the sources.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, [Russia and Assad were mainly attacking non-ISIS targets](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-true-victory-in-syria-isnt-over-isis/). \n\nEven if this was true ( I'm pretty sure Russia has been involved with Syria in hitting ISIS targets, though I'm not sure if that's been \"the bulk\" of its involvement, it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't), it's not entirely unsurprising. There's an entire uprising in Syria that's trying to upend Assad from power, it's not surprising at all that the Kremlin is more interested in removing those elements from Syria where they have no international support while allowing the international support to attack ISIS.\n\n&gt; It's well documented Assad released extremist prisoners into the opposition to discredit them. \n\nThis has nothing to do with what we're talking about.\n\n&gt;[This is not to mention the chemical attacks and forced disappearances.](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/05/syria-will-poison-the-region-for-years-to-come) \n\nWhile horrible, this has nothing to do with what we're talking about.\n\n&gt;Saying the US was responsible for what happened in Syria and **wasn't actually a force for good** is extremely big-brain and ignorant my dude. \n\nThis is a very naive/disturbing take on the entire situation and makes me wonder if you're more ideologically neo-con vs neoliberal (whatever that last word even means these days). The US has zero interest in Syria to be a \"force for good\", we're there battling for geopolitical interest (Assad is a fierce ally to Putin and Syria contains one of two of Russia's warm water ports left, Tartus). If we cared so much about chemical weapon attacks and what not, we wouldn't have allowed Saddam to stay in power after the first Gulf War. Keep in mind that Hussein was a man that Bush Sr. literally described as \"worse than Hitler\" after Kuwait...\n\nIt's been a long time since I've debated Middle East issues so my characterization of some things may be off, feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, I may be misremembering specifics but I don't think my overall narrative (the US is invested in dethroning Assad, + we botched the transfer of Iraq over to the new regime, both significant factors in the growth/perseverance of ISIS) is incorrect.","link":"https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/d345gx/discussion_thread/ezz6wnw/"},{"type":"Reddit","date":1568278879,"text":"&gt;Generally, as problematic as Maduro might be (and he definitely is) he's still the democratically-elected leader of that country\n\nIs he?

Basically any woman who engages in sexual behavior should avoid alcohol for the next week at least until they can confirm they aren't pregnant, and other risky behaviors that could cause miscarriages should be avoided as well.\n\n&gt; The Morality debate was probably the worst part since neither of them could correctly state/remember the arguments in the Marquis article. \n\nWhy should I be tasked with remembering an argument that I never made?
