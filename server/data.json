I called this out because it was rightfully a horrible point. ie: if my kid is playing outside in the snow and freezes to death, that wouldn't be considered a \"natural death.\" If a woman was denied hospital care and gave birth to a child in a parking lot and died, we wouldn't consider that a \"natural death.\" If someone starves to death due to lack of food, we don't consider that to be a \"natural death.\"\n\n\"Genocide\" might be a stretch, but if we truly believe that miscarriages are death, we could do a whole lot more to make sure women are immediately aware of any pregnancies. Basically any woman who engages in sexual behavior should avoid alcohol for the next week at least until they can confirm they aren't pregnant, and other risky behaviors that could cause miscarriages should be avoided as well.\n\n&gt; The Morality debate was probably the worst part since neither of them could correctly state/remember the arguments in the Marquis article. \n\nWhy should I be tasked with remembering an argument that I never made?
